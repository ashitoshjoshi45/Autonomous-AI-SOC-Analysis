//This are the logs ## 📂 Project Data: server_logs.txt
The `server_logs.txt` file is the heart of this simulation. It represents the raw data that a SOC Analyst would monitor in a real enterprise environment.

* **How it's created:** This file is dynamically populated by running `python log_generator.py`.
* **What it simulates:** It mimics standard Linux `auth.log` entries, including successful logins and failed "brute-force" attempts from various IP addresses.
* **Purpose:** It provides the "telemetry" needed for the AI Analyst (`ai_soc_V.py`) to detect suspicious patterns.
